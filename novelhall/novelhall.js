/*
 * NovelHall — Kuma JavaScript source, prose, English.
 *
 * Added for one reason: **Ascendance of a Bookworm is 677 chapters here**, the
 * whole web edition, where FreeWebNovel stops at 216 (volume 7 part 1). Re:Zero
 * Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu is 870 and Mushoku Tensei is 285. All three are
 * findable by their English titles, and the whole chapter list of each arrives
 * in **one request** — the series page carries it, so there is no pagination to
 * walk and no private endpoint to depend on.
 *
 * It is its own engine rather than a manifest line on FreeWebNovel's because
 * nothing about the markup is shared: listings are table rows, prose is
 * `<br>`-separated inside one container, and chapter URLs are numeric ids.
 *
 * Nine things about the site shape this file, every one measured live on
 * 2026-09-17 through the app's own client (the site 403s `curl`, so nothing
 * here was learned from a script):
 *
 *  - **Paragraphs are separated by `<br><br>` and are not wrapped in anything.**
 *    `div#htmlContent` holds the whole chapter as one run of text with breaks
 *    between paragraphs, so a `<p>` read finds nothing at all: a chapter that
 *    exists, loads, and arrives empty. The markup is split on the breaks and
 *    each piece is a page. This is the one difference that earns a separate
 *    file.
 *
 *  - **A chapter's URL is a numeric id, not its number**, and the *labels* are
 *    not trustworthy either. Bookworm's list runs "Chapter 1", "Chapter 2",
 *    "Chapter Three", "Chapter Four" — ten rows spell the number out — and four
 *    more go *backwards* (92, 90, 88, 85) because the site mislabelled them. A
 *    number lifted from the label leaves the reader's chapter list
 *    non-monotonic, which sorts it into nonsense and makes tracker progress
 *    move backwards. Position in the site's own list is used instead, and the
 *    numeric ids confirm that order: they rise strictly, 1006904 → 1007704
 *    across all 675 rows.
 *
 *  - **A chapter can live under a different slug from its novel.** Re:Zero's
 *    series page is `/rezero-kara-hajimeru-isekai-seikatsu-26650/` and its
 *    newest chapters are under `/rezero-kara-hajimeru-isekai-seikatsu-wn-26650/`
 *    — same book, two slugs, one id. Scoping the chapter list by slug the way a
 *    normal scrape would drops 300 chapters off the end of the longest novel on
 *    the site. Everything here is scoped by the **id**.
 *
 *  - **A series page carries three lists in identical markup.** "The Newest
 *    Chapter" (nine rows, newest first) above, `div#morelist` (the real list,
 *    oldest first) in the middle, and "Recommended Reading" below, which links
 *    *other novels*. An unscoped read puts chapter 677 where chapter one
 *    belongs, repeats nine rows, and files four other people's novels as
 *    chapters of this one.
 *
 *  - **The listing pager is dead markup and it lies.** Every ranking page ships
 *    its pager commented out, pointing at `/allvisit-2.html` — which answers
 *    404. The pagination that works is the listing's own stem with `-N`:
 *    `/ranking-2.html` and `/ranking-40.html` both return twenty fresh rows.
 *    So no pager is read anywhere in this file; the page number is built, and
 *    the end of a listing is "the page returned nothing".
 *
 *  - **Search is a query the site does not advertise**, `/index.php` with
 *    `s=so&module=book&keyword=…`, and it is accurate: "Ascendance of a
 *    Bookworm" returns exactly one row. A route it doesn't recognise —
 *    `/search-keyword-x.html`, which its own `robots.txt` names — answers
 *    **HTTP 200 with the homepage**, whose "Latest Release Novel" block is a
 *    table of twenty rows in the same markup as a result list. Read as results
 *    that is twenty unrelated novels for every query, and on the import screen
 *    it is worse: a book the user owns gets matched against whatever the site
 *    posted this morning. A search page states so in its own `<title>` and
 *    carries no `<h3>` heading where every listing has one; anything else
 *    throws.
 *
 *  - **A scattered "P" is not a paragraph.** The machine translation leaves a
 *    bare capital P between paragraphs — twelve of them in the 272 of Bookworm
 *    chapter 677 — and each one would be a page of the reader showing a single
 *    letter. Dropped as the artifact it is, while one-word dialogue ("Mine",
 *    "Help") is kept, because that really is the text.
 *
 *  - **Some novels repeat the chapter title as the first paragraph and some
 *    don't.** Re:Zero does, Bookworm doesn't, and the repeat is not an exact
 *    copy — the heading writes `'The Wishes…` where the prose writes `“The
 *    Wishes…`. Compared with the punctuation removed, so the reader doesn't get
 *    a first page holding only the title it just tapped.
 *
 *  - **The blurb the site shows is the truncated one.** `span.js-open-wrap` is
 *    the visible two sentences ending "more>>" and `span.js-close-wrap` is the
 *    whole thing, hidden behind `display:none` until the reader expands it. The
 *    hidden one is the one worth having, which is the opposite of the usual
 *    rule about hidden text.
 *
 * ── Covers, deliberately ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **No listing on this site carries cover art, and neither does search.** They
 * are table rows of titles; the art exists only on a novel's own page. Fetching
 * it for a shelf would be one request per row — twenty per listing — so shelves
 * show `MangaCover`'s gradient placeholder, the same as Dynasty's. What is
 * checked instead is the cover of a novel the reader *opened*, which is the one
 * the app puts on the title screen and in the library, and which the live test
 * fetches the way a grid cell does.
 *
 * ── What a manifest may set (`kuma.options`, all values are strings) ─────────
 *
 *   popularPath   listing stem for the popular shelf, default "ranking"
 *   latestPath    listing stem for the latest shelf, default "lastupdate"
 *   searchPath    where a query goes, default "/index.php"
 *   searchParams  the fixed part of a search query, default "s=so&module=book"
 *   searchField   the field the query itself goes in, default "keyword"
 *
 * No selectors here, deliberately: `HTMLSelector` degrades silently, so a
 * mistyped one in a manifest gives wrong rows rather than an error.
